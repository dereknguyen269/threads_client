  username: "Instagram's username",
  password: "Instagram's password"
}

ThreadsClient.config do |config|
  config.credentials = credentials
end
```

Using **usertoken** and **userid** (get from [here](#ðŸ¤–-get-usertoken-and-userid))

  usertoken: "token received after login successfull",
  userid: "Instagram's user id"

ThreadsClient.config do |config|
  config.credentials = credentials
