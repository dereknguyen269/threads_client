# Getting Started

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'threads_client_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install threads_client_ruby

## Usage
#### ðŸŒ€ Config Threads

Using **username** and **password** (first time)
```ruby
credentials = {
  username: "Instagram's username",
  password: "Instagram's password"
}

ThreadsClientRuby.config do |config|
  config.credentials = credentials
end
```

Using **usertoken** and **userid** (get from [here](#ðŸ¤–-get-usertoken-and-userid))
```ruby
credentials = {
  usertoken: "token received after login successfull",
  userid: "Instagram's user id"
}

ThreadsClientRuby.config do |config|
  config.credentials = credentials
end
```

>ðŸ’¡ TIP: Using **usertoken** and **userid** to avoid Theard rate limit and decrease response time.

#### ðŸ¤– Get usertoken and userid

```ruby
  userinfo = ThreadsClientRuby.get_userinfo
  # {
  #   :usertoken=> "eyJkc191c2VyX2lkIjoiNTgzOTIyMTY....",
  #   :userid=>"583922..."
  # }
```
